## 0.0.1-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- - **Automated reply with loop prevention.** Chats are kept alive until the
    assistant interrupts the conversation.
  - **Group chats.** Agents chat with multiple other agents at the same time as
    if they were in a Whatsapp group. The next agent to reply is chosen based on
    the conversation and predicted most likely to reply.
